    "# Modelling the Effect of Stimulated Emission Depletion on Single Photon Emission\n",
    "The quantisation of photoexcitation results in the emission of a single photon. There are various different types of Single Photon Emitters (SPEs), however we are most interested in colour centres in hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) due to their applicability in quantum information processing applications. Therefore, in this code values for rate constants will be taken from measured values for hBN colour centre defect, however by changing these values this code could be implimented for other SPEs.\n",
    "Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) is the process of using a photon to promote decay back to the ground state through a phonon-assisted pathway. Here we attempt to model the effect STED will have on the maximum rate of single photon emission from an SPE. It is hoped that STED can be used to increase the yeild of single photons, which would help improve the applications it is used for."
